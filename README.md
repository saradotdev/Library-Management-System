# Library-Management-System

This C++ program implements a basic library management system with functionalities for both teachers and students. Upon execution, the user is prompted to choose between logging in as a teacher or a student, or to exit the program. Teachers can add and delete books from the library and view the list of available books, while students can borrow and return books or view the list of available books. The system utilizes file handling to store book information in a "Books.txt" file.
